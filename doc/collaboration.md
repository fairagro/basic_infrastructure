# Comparisson of collaboration tools for the FAIRagro project

## Considered Tools

 - NextCloud (https://nextcloud.com)
 - OwnCloud (https://owncloud.com/)
 - CollaboraOffice (https://www.collaboraoffice.com)
 - OnlyOffice (https://www.onlyoffice.com/)
 - GroupOffice (https://www.group-office.com/)
 - Cryptpad (https://cryptpad.fr)

All tools are open source (at least partly) and can be hosted on premise or be bought in the cloud as SaaS.

## NextCloud/OwnCloud

NextCloud is a fork of OwnCloud so they are quite similar. The core task of NextCloud/OwnCloud is to offer shared network storage ("cloud" on premise). Additionally both offer the integration of so-called apps -- mostly for collaboration purposes. There is a huge number of apps available: https://apps.nextcloud.com/, https://marketplace.owncloud.com/apps.

NextCloud is fully open source whereas many OwnCloud features are only available for payment. This includes integration with Microsoft Office (which is much better than the NextCloud solution) and sadly also federated authentication using SAML.

So the conclusion is: as long as we cannot afford to pay several thousand Euros per year for OwnCloud we have to opt for NextCloud.

## CollaboraOffice/OnlyOffice

Both are NextCloud Apps that offer office document collaboration. CollaboraOffice is more oriented towards LibreOffice and primarily runs on the server whereas OnlyOffice is oriented towards MicrosoftOffice and mainly runs in the browser. Both can be installed simultaneously.
The drawback of both solutions is that they support a limited numbers of simultaneous users (20 in both cases), in addition OnlyOffice also limits the total amount users to 40. The limits can be increased by buying additional software licinses.
OnlyOffice was known for bugs and security issues in the past.

## GroupOffice

GroupOffice is a so-called Groupware software and offers a brought range of office collaboration tools. This includes Email, Chat, Helpdesk and even CRM; file sharing is also included. Unfortunately, key functionalities like document editing are only available for payment, though it is quite cheap: 200 Euros per year for unlimited users (if hosted on premise).
There is a brought range of products that are similar to GroupOffice: EGroupware (https://www.egroupware.org), Kopano (https://kopano.com), FengOffice (https://fengoffice.com) and Zimbra (https://www.zimbra.com)...

## CryptPad

Cryptpad is a collaboration solution with a very limited feature set. It currently does not offer many standard office functionalities like documents and slides. Mainly spreadsheets, RTF and Markdown are supported.
Cryptpad specializes on privacy and security and is available on premise without fees.
